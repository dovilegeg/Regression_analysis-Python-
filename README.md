Regression analysis with Python (predicting GDP Per Capita)

Regression Analysis Project Summary


Objective

To predict GDP Per Capita using key economic and demographic indicators.

Data Overview

Predictors: Education Expenditure (% GDP), Health Expenditure (% GDP), Unemployment, Population Density, Inflation Rate.
Target: GDP Per Capita.

Data Preprocessing

Missing values were imputed with the median.
Data was split into train (80%) and test (20%) sets.

Modeling

A Linear Regression model was trained and evaluated:
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 439,154,371
RÂ² Score: 0.128

Findings

The model explained 12.8% of the variance in GDP Per Capita.
Weak correlations between predictors suggest the need for additional features.

Next Steps

Add more relevant predictors.
Address potential outliers.
Explore advanced models like Ridge, Lasso, or non-linear methods
